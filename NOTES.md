# Antikythera — decisions log

Plan of record: `~/.claude/plans/i-would-like-to-bubbly-boot.md` (approved 2026-09-12).

## Decisions
- 2026-09-12 Baseline reconstruction = Freeth et al. 2021 "Cosmos" (CC-BY). Disputed parts parametric.
- 2026-09-12 No third-party geometry imported. Every gear generated from `data/gears.json`.
- 2026-09-12 Time coordinate = Julian Day Number; proleptic Julian calendar for BC; astronomical year numbering.
- 2026-09-12 Epochs: Carman & Evans 205 BC (JDN 1646680) default; Voulgaris 178 BC (JDN 1656764) toggle.

- 2026-09-12 Epoch JDNs verified with two independent algorithms: 12 May 205 BC = **1646679** (the
  research note said 1646680; that came from a Wikipedia formula that truncates toward zero and is off
  by one for negative years), 22 Dec 178 BC = 1656764. Cross-check: the glyph model's month-2 lunar
  glyph lands on NASA's partial lunar eclipse of 11 Jun 205 BC and month 8 on the total of 5 Dec 205 BC.
- 2026-09-12 Superior-planet trains read off Freeth 2021 Supp. Fig. S23b: Saturn 56~52+61~40~68⊕86~86,
  Jupiter 56~64+45~40~43⊕65~65, Mars 56~64+38~40~71⊕80~80, true Sun 56~52~56⊕follower. Table S9 offsets
  Mars 6.58 / Jupiter 1.58 / Saturn 1.50 mm; pin radii 10.00 / 8.22 / 14.37 mm.
- 2026-09-12 Back-train arbor directions taken from Thomas Weibel's CC-BY model (assets/raw); distances
  always recomputed from tooth counts and modules.
